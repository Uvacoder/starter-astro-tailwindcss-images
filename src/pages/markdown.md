# A markdown page

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words _italic_ with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

- Start a line with a star
- Profit!

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
>
> - Captain Janeway

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
